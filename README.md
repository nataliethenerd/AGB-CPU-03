# AGB-CPU-03
This is a reverse engineered board by me, Natalie the Nerd.

I made this to learn and fix some super corroded boards I have.

### Shout out to:

- the original repair manual for the AGB which helped me confirm my first ever reverse engineered schematic
- HDR for his HQ board scans which I used to help draw up the kicad footprints
